For example, a function might return the distance travelled by a cyclist in a period of time, and you can use a secant line to measure the average velocity between two points in time.

We can use derivatives to find the slope at a specific *x* value by calculating a delta for *x<sub>1</sub>* and *x<sub>2</sub>* values that are infinitesimally close together - so you can think of it as measuring the slope of a tiny straight line that comprises part of the curve.\n",

    "## Derivative Rules and Operations\n",
    "When working with derivatives, there are some rules, or shortcuts, that you can apply to make your life easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Derivative Rules\n",
    "Let's start with some basic rules that it's useful to know.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If *f(x)* = *C* (where *C* is a constant), then *f'(x)* = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    This makes sense if you think about it for a second. No matter what value you use for *x*, the function returns the same constant value; so the graph of the function will be a horizontal line. There's no rate of change in a horiziontal line, so its slope is 0 at all points. This is true of any constant, including symbolic constants like *&pi;* (pi).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    So, for example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "\\begin{equation}f(x) = 6 \\;\\; \\therefore \\;\\; f'(x) = 0 \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "    Or:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f(x) = \\pi \\;\\; \\therefore \\;\\; f'(x) = 0 \\end{equation}\n",
    "    \n",
    "- If *f(x)* = *Cg(x)*, then *f'(x)* = *Cg'(x)*\n",
    "\n",
    "    This rule tells us that if a function is equal to a second function multiplied by a constant, then the derivative of the first function will be equal to the derivative of the second function multiplied by the same constant. For example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "\\begin{equation}f(x) = 2g(x) \\;\\; \\therefore \\;\\; f'(x) = 2g'(x) \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "- If *f(x)* = *g(x)* + *h(x)*, then *f'(x)* = *g'(x)* + *h'(x)*\n",
    "\n",
    "    In other words, if a function is the sum of two other functions, then the derivative of the first function is the sum of the derivatives of the other two functions. For example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "\\begin{equation}f(x) = g(x) + h(x) \\;\\; \\therefore \\;\\; f'(x) = g'(x) + h'(x) \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "    Of course, this also applies to subtraction:\n",
    "    \n",
    "\\begin{equation}f(x) = k(x) - l(x) \\;\\; \\therefore \\;\\; f'(x) = k'(x) - l'(x) \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed previously, functions are just equations encapsulated as a named entity that return a value; and the rules can be applied to any equation. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{d}{dx}(2x + 6) = \\frac{d}{dx} 2x +  \\frac{d}{dx} 6\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can take advantage of the rules to make the calculation a little easier:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{d}{dx}(2x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{2(x+h) - 2x}{h} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "After factoring out the* 2(x+h)* on the left, this is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{d}{dx}(2x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{2x + 2h - 2x}{h} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We can simplify this to:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{d}{dx}(2x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{2h}{h} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Which gives us:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{d}{dx}(2x) = 2 \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can turn our attention to the derivative of the constant 6 with respect to *x*, and we know that the derivative of a constant is always 0, so:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{d}{dx}(6) = 0\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We add the two derivatives we calculated:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{d}{dx}(2x + 6) = 2 + 0\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Which gives us our result:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{d}{dx}(2x + 6) = 2\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Power Rule\n",
    "The *power rule* is one of the most useful shortcuts in the world of differential calculus. It can be stated like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f(x) = x^{n} \\;\\; \\therefore \\;\\; f'(x) = nx^{n-1}\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "So if our function for *x* returns *x* to the power of some constant (which we'll call *n*), then the derivative of the function for *x* is *n* times *x* to the power of *n* - 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's probably helpful to look at a few examples to see how this works:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f(x) = x^{3} \\;\\; \\therefore \\;\\; f'(x) = 3x^{2}\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f(x) = x^{-2} \\;\\; \\therefore \\;\\; f'(x) = -2x^{-3}\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f(x) = x^{2} \\;\\; \\therefore \\;\\; f'(x) = 2x\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "In each of these examples, the exponential of *x* in the function definition becomes the coefficient for *x* in the derivative definition, with the exponential is decremented by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a worked example to find the derivative of the following function:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f(x) = x^{2}\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "So we start with the general derivative function:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We can plug in our definition for *f*:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{(x + h)^{2} - x^{2}}{h} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can factor out the perfect square binomial on the left:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{x^{2} + h^{2} + 2xh - x^{2}}{h} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The x<sup>2</sup> terms cancel each other out so we get to:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{h^{2} + 2xh}{h} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Which simplifies to:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} h + 2x \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "With *h* approaching 0, this is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f'(x) = 0 + 2x \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "So our answer is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f'(x) = 2x \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we could have achieved the same result by simply applying the power rule and transforming x<sup>2</sup> to 2x<sup>1</sup> (which is the same as 2x).\n",

    "### The Product Rule\n",
    "The product rule can be stated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)g(x)] = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x) \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, let's break that down. What it's saying is that the derivative of *f(x)* multiplied by *g(x)* is equal to the derivative of *f(x)* multiplied by the value of *g(x)* added to the value of *f(x)* multiplied by the derivative of *g(x*).\n",

    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f'(x) = 4x \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's look at *g'(x)*:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}g'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{(x + h) + 1 - (x + 1)}{h} \\end{equation}\n",

For example, here's our function for the kicked football:\n",

    "The ability to use derivatives to find minima and maxima of a function makes it a useful tool for scenarios where you need to optimize a function for a specific variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining Functions to be Optimized\n",
    "For example, suppose you have decided to build an online video service that is based on a subscription model. You plan to charge a monthly subscription fee, and you want to make the most revenue possible. The problem is that customers are price-sensitive, so if you set the monthly fee too high, you'll deter some customers from signing up. Conversely, if you set the fee too low, you may get more customers, but at the cost of reduced revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "What you need is some kind of function that will tell you how many subscriptions you might expect to get based on a given fee. So you've done some research, and found a formula to indicate that the expected subscription volume (in thousands) can be calculated as 5-times the monthly fee subtracted from 100; or expressed as a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}s(x) = -5x + 100\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "What you actually want to optimize is monthly revenue, which is simply the number of subscribers multiplied by the fee:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}r(x) = s(x) \\cdot x\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We can combine ***s(x)*** into ***r(x)*** like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}r(x) = -5x^{2} + 100x\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding the Prime Derivative\n",
    "The function ***r(x)*** will return the expected monthly revenue (in thousands) for any proposed fee (*x*). What we need to do now is to find the fee that yields the maximum revenue. Fortunately, we can use a derivative to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to determine the prime derivative of ***r(x)***, and we can do that easily using the power rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}r'(x) = 2 \\cdot -5x + 100\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}r'(x) = -10x + 100\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "### Find Critical Points\n",
    "Now we need to find any critical points where the derivative is 0, as this could indicate a maximum:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}-10x + 100 = 0\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's isolate the *x* term:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}-10x = -100\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Both sides are negative, so we can mulitply both by -1 to make them positive without affecting the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}10x = 100\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can divide both sides by 10 to isolate *x*:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}x = \\frac{100}{10}\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "So:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}x = 10\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Check for a Maximum\n",
    "We now know that with an *x* value of of **10**, the derivative is 0; or put another way, when the fee is 10, the slope indicating the change in subscription volume is flat. This could potentially be a point where the change in subscription volume has peaked (in other words, a maximum); but it could also be a minimum or just an inflexion point where the rate of change transitions from negative to positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be sure, we can check the second order derivative. We can calculate this by applying the power rule to the prime derivative:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}r''(x) = -10\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the second derivative is a constant with a negative value. It will be the same for any point, including our critical point at *x=10*:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}r''(10) = -10\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "A negative value for the second derivative tells us that the derivative slope is moving in a negative direction at the point where it is 0, so the function value must be at a maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the optimal monthly fee for our online video service is 10 - this will generate the maximum monthly revenue.\n",
    "\n",
